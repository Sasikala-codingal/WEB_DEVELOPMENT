                    <p>
                        Parrots are a diverse group (Order: Psittaciformes) with many species like Macaws, Cockatoos, Lovebirds, Conures, and Budgerigars (Budgies), known for vibrant colors and intelligence, including famous talking species like the African Grey and Rose-ringed Parakeet, with scientific names varying greatly, e.g., Psittacus erithacus for African Grey.

                        Parrots eat a varied diet of fresh fruits, vegetables, nuts, seeds, and grains, supplemented by formulated pellets, but their needs differ by species (e.g., macaws love nuts, lorikeets eat nectar). A balanced diet includes pellets (70-90%) and fresh foods (10-30%), like leafy greens, carrots, bananas, apples, cooked beans, and occasional protein, while avoiding toxic foods like avocado, chocolate, and salty snacks. </p>
